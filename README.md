### Hi there 👋 I'm Serkan

A frontend developer from Turkey/Istanbul

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on E-commerce 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React-Native, Webdrive.io, QA automation.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Listen Rap Music. Make music. Drawing is textured art.

Note: For a terminal view of this intro, use ```npx serkan-uslu``` I think it's so cool 😎
